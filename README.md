Stock Price Forecasting with Arithmetic Brownian Motion

**Objectives:**

The project aimed to analyze the performance of small and large value stocks versus growth stocks in the US market. It sought to investigate whether there were significant differences in returns between these categories over a historical period.

**Data:**

Data was sourced from the "french_6portfolios.txt" dataset, encompassing historical returns of various stock portfolios categorized by size and style (value vs. growth). The dataset covered a substantial period, enabling a comprehensive analysis.

**Key Outcomes:**

- Performance Analysis: The project revealed that small value stocks consistently outperformed both large value and growth stocks in the long run, aligning with previous research findings.
- Statistical Testing: Utilizing R Studio, paired t-tests were conducted to compare returns between different categories of stocks. Results indicated significant differences in returns, particularly favoring small value stocks.
- Geometric Mean Calculation: Geometric mean was employed to assess portfolio returns accurately, considering compounding effects and non-independent data, which is typical in stock returns analysis.

**Statistical Tools in R Studio:**

- Paired t-tests: Used to compare returns between different categories of stocks, determining if differences were statistically significant.
- Geometric Mean Calculation: Employed to provide a more precise measure of historical returns, considering the compounding effects inherent in stock returns.

This project not only provided insights into historical stock performance but also demonstrated the utility of statistical tools like t-tests and geometric mean calculation in financial analysis, showcasing their application in R Studio for data-driven decision-making.
